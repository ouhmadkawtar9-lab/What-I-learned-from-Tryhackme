# Difference between IP and MAC Address

An **IP address** can change depending on the network you are connected to.  
For example, if you move from your home Wi-Fi to your company’s Wi-Fi, your IP address will change automatically.  
We use IP addresses to identify which network a device belongs to — for example, accounting, management, or guest network.

A **MAC address**, on the other hand, is like a fingerprint for your computer.  
It never changes and is unique for each device.  
Network administrators can use it to know exactly which device is connected, even if the IP changes.

**In short:**  
- IP address = Where the device is.  
- MAC address = Who the device is.
